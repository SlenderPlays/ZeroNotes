# Zero's Notes
## About the project
This project, more than anything is an experiment, and a training project to understand and experience the creation of an Android App from start to finish, and to serve as a personal tool.

The main idea behind the project is to keep track of different activities that need to be done - like a "To-Do List". For a good time I have used "Samsung Notes" to create checklists for different things I want to do on a day-by-day basis but also reapeating actions - habits that I wanted to create. This meant creating a new "Note" every day an adding the tasks that I wanted to do that day - be it the same as yesterday's or otherwise. After a month of this creation-recreating business I got tired of it and I decided to start this project.

The App deals with different types of "Notes":
* Notes (Simple) - they just are a "to-do" that is unique.
* Habits - similarly, still a "to-do" but one which resets each day.
* Projects - A type of note that isn't dependent on a date - just a certian project or thing you want to do: for example a project like this one!

## Learning
As I've said before, the main goal of this app is to learn all about the Android App development cycle, from simple things like making a button work, to more complicated concepts like (de)serialization, project planning and structuring, working with Custom UI Components, working with RecyclerViews, and so on...

At this moment in time the project isn't quite complete, so whenever I do finish it I'll come back here to remark the things that I have learned so far.
